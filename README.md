just drop this in a folder and run the main.py (make sure you have python 3.8+ installed)

it requires internet to run at the start

constant updates, so you might want to make sure you have the latest version if it feels boring.

make sure you have all the files in the same folder so the game can run without errors

use the run as idle option in the right click menu

Anyways, Have fun!
